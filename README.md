# GenEco - Responsible Business Practices through AI

## Overview
**GenEco** is a pioneering initiative designed to leverage artificial intelligence to foster more responsible business practices. This project is aimed at enhancing environmental sustainability, promoting social equality and inclusivity, and informing governance and policy. **GenEco** uses a data-first approach, integrating Generative AI (GenAI) to address and mitigate the risks associated with AI deployments, particularly in the domains of corporate responsibility.

## Features
- **Carbon Footprint Simulation**: Calculate and simulate the carbon footprint of AI operations, providing actionable insights into energy consumption and emission reductions.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilize extensive data analytics to offer recommendations for optimizing business processes and reducing environmental impact.
- **Policy Frameworks**: Develop governance models that incorporate responsible AI usage to ensure compliance and ethical AI deployment.

## Technology Stack
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Tools like NVIDIA AI Enterprise and AWS Machine Learning for predictive analytics and data processing.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Utilizes services from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure for scalable, secure cloud computing.
- **Data Security**: Integration of Cisco Hypershield for enhanced AI data center and cloud security.
